With Automatron and a few minutes you can setup a fully autonomous monitoring and remediation system. The below steps will show how to install and configure Automatron to monitor Nginx on all servers with a hostname that matches `*web*` and restart the service if it is not running.

## Install and Configure Automatron

Automatron is currently available by cloning the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/madflojo/automatron/). With the first release candidate it will also be available via a Docker image.

### Prerequisites

The below list is a set of base requirements for a running Automatron instance.

  * Python 2.7 or higher
  * Redis
  * nmap

### Clone from Github

First, clone the current repository from GitHub.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/madflojo/automatron.git
$ cd automatron
```

### Install required python modules

Second, install any required python modules.

```sh
$ sudo pip install -r requirements.txt
$ sudo pip install honcho
```

### Setup a base configuration

Third, create a configuration file using the `config/config.yml.example` file as a base.

```sh
$ cp config/config.yml.example config/config.yml
$ vi config/config.yml
```

##### Defining an SSH Key

Automatron relies on SSH to perform both monitoring and actioning. To enable this a public SSH key must be deployed on all target servers and the private key stored within the `ssh` section of the configuration file.

```yaml
ssh: # SSH Configuration
  user: root
  gateway: False
  key: |
        -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
        fdlkfjasldjfsaldkjflkasjflkjaflsdlkfjs
        -----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
```

The `gateway` setting can be used to specify a "jump server" for Automatron to connect to. If left as `False` Automatron will simply login to each target host directly.

##### Setup the nmap Discovery plugin

Automatron discovers new hosts via two default methods, the first is a web "ping" which can be any HTTP request to the port specified within the configuration file.

The second method is a `nmap` scan. Within the config file you can specify a custom network subnet for Automatron to scan.

```yaml
## Use NMAP to find new hosts
nmap:
  target: 10.0.0.1/8
  flags: -sP
  interval: 40
```

The `flags` configuration is used to pass command line arguments to `nmap`.

## Writing our first Runbook

A Runbook is a policy that defines health checks and automated actions to be performed when those health checks return specified states.

For this example we will create a new Runbook.

```sh
$ mkdir -p config/runbooks/base/check_nginx
$ vi config/runbooks/base/check_nginx/init.yml
```

Once the file is open simply paste the following Runbook policy.

```yaml
name: Verify nginx is running
schedule: "*/5 * * * *"
nodes:
  - "*web*"
checks:
  nginx_is_running:
    # Check if nginx is running
    execute_from: ontarget
    type: cmd
    cmd: service nginx status
actions:
  restart_nginx:
    execute_from: ontarget
    trigger: 2
    frequency: 300
    call_on:
      - WARNING
      - CRITICAL
    type: cmd
    cmd: service nginx restart
```

The above policy will run the `service nginx status` command every 5 minutes on any target that has a hostname that matches `*web*`. If that command fails after 2 occurrences the `restart_nginx` action will be "triggered" and executed on the target server.

## Applying Runbooks to Target hosts

Within the Runbook above we specified the target nodes that the runbook applies to. There is another level of targeting available within the `config/runbooks/init.yml` file. This provides additional granularity to the application of Runbooks.

To get started we will replace the contents of this file with settings specific to our current task.

```yaml
'*':
  - base/check_nginx
```

## Starting Automatron

Once our configuration and runbook is defined we can startup Automatron and watch as our webservers are discovered and monitored autonamously.

```sh
$ honcho start
```
