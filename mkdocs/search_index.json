Simply put, it detects system events \n takes action to correct them.\n\n\nThe goal of Automatron is to allow users to automate the execution of common tasks performed during system events. These tasks can be as simple as \nsending an email\n to as complicated as \nrestarting services across multiple hosts\n.\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\n\nAutomatically detect and add new systems to monitor\n\n\nMonitoring is executed over SSH and completely \nagent-less\n\n\nPolicy based \nRunbooks\n allow for monitoring policies rather than server specific configurations\n\n\nSupports Nagios compliant health check scripts\n\n\nAllows dead simple \narbitrary shell commands\n for both \nchecks\n and \nactions\n\n\nRunbook flexibility with \nJinja2\n templating support\n\n\nPluggable Architecture that simplifies customization\n\n\nBootstrap based dashboard showing real-time events\n\n\n\n\nRunbooks\n\n\nThe core of Automatron is based around \nRunbooks\n. Runbooks are policies that define health checks and actions. You can think of them in the same way you would think of a printed runbook. Except with Automatron, the actions are automated.\n\n\nA simple Runbook example\n\n\nThe below runbook is a very basic example, it will check if NGINX is running (every 2 minutes) and restart it after 2 unsuccessful checks.\n\n\nname\n:\n \nCheck NGINX\n\n\nschedule\n:\n \n*/2\n \n*\n \n*\n \n*\n \n*\n\n\nchecks\n:\n\n  \nnginx_is_running\n:\n\n    \nexecute_from\n:\n \ntarget\n\n    \ntype\n:\n \ncmd\n\n    \ncmd\n:\n \nservice nginx status\n\n\nactions\n:\n\n  \nrestart_nginx\n:\n\n    \nexecute_from\n:\n \ntarget\n\n    \ntrigger\n:\n \n2\n\n    \nfrequency\n:\n \n300\n\n    \ncall_on\n:\n\n      \n-\n \nWARNING\n\n      \n-\n \nCRITICAL\n\n      \n-\n \nUNKNOWN\n\n    \ntype\n:\n \ncmd\n\n    \ncmd\n:\n \nservice nginx restart\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above actions will be performed every 300 seconds (5 minutes) until the health check returns an OK status. This delay allows time for NGINX to restart after each execution.\n\n\nA complex Runbook with Jinja2\n\n\nThis next runbook example is a more complex version of the above. In this example we will use Jinja2 and Automatron's Facts to enhance our runbook further.\n\n\nname\n:\n \nCheck NGINX\n\n\n{%\n \nif\n \nprod\n \nin\n \nfacts\n[\nhostname\n]\n \n%}\n\n\nschedule\n:\n\n  \nsecond\n:\n \n*\n/20\n\n\n{%\n \nelse\n \n%}\n\n\nschedule\n:\n \n*/2\n \n*\n \n*\n \n*\n \n*\n\n\n{%\n \nendif\n \n%}\n\n\nchecks\n:\n\n  \nnginx_is_running\n:\n\n    \nexecute_from\n:\n \ntarget\n\n    \ntype\n:\n \ncmd\n\n    \ncmd\n:\n \nservice nginx status\n\n\nactions\n:\n\n  \nrestart_nginx\n:\n\n    \nexecute_from\n:\n \ntarget\n\n    \ntrigger\n:\n \n2\n\n    \nfrequency\n:\n \n300\n\n    \ncall_on\n:\n\n      \n-\n \nWARNING\n\n      \n-\n \nCRITICAL\n\n      \n-\n \nUNKNOWN\n\n    \ntype\n:\n \ncmd\n\n    \ncmd\n:\n \nservice nginx restart\n\n  \nremove_from_dns\n:\n\n    \nexecute_from\n:\n \nremote\n\n    \ntrigger\n:\n \n0\n\n    \nfrequency\n:\n \n0\n\n    \ncall_on\n:\n\n      \n-\n \nWARNING\n\n      \n-\n \nCRITICAL\n\n      \n-\n \nUNKNOWN\n\n    \ntype\n:\n \nplugin\n\n    \nplugin\n:\n \ncloudflare/dns.py\n\n    \nargs\n:\n \nremove test@example.com apikey123 example.com --content\n \n{{\n \nfacts\n[\nnetwork\n][\neth0\n][\nv4\n][\n0\n]\n \n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above example uses \nJinja2\n and \nFacts\n to create a conditional schedule. If our target server has a hostname that contains the word \"prod\" within it. The schedule for the health check will be every 20 seconds.

            "text": "The core of Automatron is based around \nRunbooks\n. Runbooks are policies that define health checks and actions. You can think of them in the same way you would think of a printed runbook. Except with Automatron, the actions are automated.\n\n\nBelow is a very simple Runbook example.\n\n\nname\n:\n \nCheck NGINX\n\n\nschedule\n:\n \n*/2\n \n*\n \n*\n \n*\n \n*\n\n\nchecks\n:\n\n  \nnginx_is_running\n:\n\n    \nexecute_from\n:\n \ntarget\n\n    \ntype\n:\n \ncmd\n\n    \ncmd\n:\n \nservice nginx status\n\n\nactions\n:\n\n  \nrestart_nginx\n:\n\n    \nexecute_from\n:\n \ntarget\n\n    \ntrigger\n:\n \n2\n\n    \nfrequency\n:\n \n300\n\n    \ncall_on\n:\n\n      \n-\n \nWARNING\n\n      \n-\n \nCRITICAL\n\n      \n-\n \nUNKNOWN\n\n    \ntype\n:\n \ncmd\n\n    \ncmd\n:\n \nservice nginx restart\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis guide will walk through creating the above runbook as well as applying this runbook to all monitored hosts.\n\n\nCreating the Runbook YAML file\n\n\nBy default, Runbooks are specified within the \nconfig/runbooks\n directory. The runbook we will be creating is used to manage the NGINX service. We will want this runbook to be easy to find. An easy way to do that would be to create the runbook with a similar name as the service it manages. We can do so in one of two ways.\n\n\nWe can either create a file \nconfig/runbooks/nginx.yml\n or \nconfig/runbooks/nginx/init.yml\n. Either option are acceptable for the next steps. For this guide we will create the file as \nconfig/runbooks/nginx/init.yml\n.\n\n\n$ mkdir -p config/runbooks/nginx\n$ vi config/runbooks/nginx/init.yml\n\n\n\n\n\nTo get started let's go ahead and create the runbook by inserting our example runbook.\n\n\nname\n:\n \nCheck NGINX\n\n\nschedule\n:\n \n*/2\n \n*\n \n*\n \n*\n \n*\n\n\nchecks\n:\n\n  \nnginx_is_running\n:\n\n    \nexecute_from\n:\n \ntarget\n\n    \ntype\n:\n \ncmd\n\n    \ncmd\n:\n \nservice nginx status\n\n\nactions\n:\n\n  \nrestart_nginx\n:\n\n    \nexecute_from\n:\n \ntarget\n\n    \ntrigger\n:\n \n2\n\n    \nfrequency\n:\n \n300\n\n    \ncall_on\n:\n\n      \n-\n \nWARNING\n\n      \n-\n \nCRITICAL\n\n      \n-\n \nUNKNOWN\n\n    \ntype\n:\n \ncmd\n\n    \ncmd\n:\n \nservice nginx restart\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Anatomy of a Runbook\n\n\nA runbook consists of 4 major parameters; \nname\n, \nschedule\n, \nchecks\n, \n \nactions\n.\n\n\nName\n\n\nThe \nname\n field is used to provide an arbitrary name for the runbook. This field is a required field and must have some value. It is required that this value be unique and not re-used by other runbooks as this name will be referenced internally within Automatron.\n\n\nSchedule\n\n\nThe \nschedule\n field is used to provide a cron formatted schedule for health check execution. A cron formatted schedule of \n*/2 * * * *\n will result in the health checks being executed every 2 minutes.\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\nDue to YAML formatting the cron schedule should be encased in single or double quotes such as \n'*/2 * * * *'\n. Failure to do so will result in a parsing error from YAML.\n\n\n\n\nAlternative schedule format\n\n\nIt is also possible to define a schedule in a key/value based cron format such as the example below.\n\n\nschedule\n:\n\n  \nsecond\n:\n \n*/15\n\n  \nminute\n:\n \n*\n\n  \nhour\n:\n \n*\n\n  \nday\n:\n \n*\n\n  \nmonth\n:\n \n*\n\n  \nday_of_week\n:\n \n*\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing this format you may omit keys that have a value of \n*\n as this is the default value. For example, the above schedule could also be represented as the below.\n\n\nschedule\n:\n\n  \nsecond\n:\n \n*/15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\nWhen using the key/value based format it is important to specify the \nsecond\n parameter, as a default value of \n*\n would result in checks being run every second.\n\n\n\n\nChecks\n\n\nThe \nchecks\n field is a YAML dictionary that contains the health checks to be executed against monitored hosts. The format of \nchecks\n is as follows.\n\n\nchecks\n:\n\n  \nname_of_check\n:\n\n    \n# health check options\n\n  \nanother_check\n:\n\n    \n# health check options\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor more details around required health check parameters please read the \nChecks\n section.\n\n\nActions\n\n\nLike \nchecks\n, the \nactions\n field is a YAML dictionary that contains actions to be executed based on health check status. The \nactions\n field also follows a similar format to the \nchecks\n field.\n\n\nactions\n:\n\n  \nname_of_action\n:\n\n    \n# Action options\n\n  \nanother_action\n:\n\n    \n# Action options\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor more details around required action parameters please read the \nActions\n section.\n\n\nApplying the Runbook\n\n\nBy creating the \nconfig/runbooks/nginx/init.yml\n we have only defined the runbook itself. This runbook however will not be applied to any monitored hosts until we specify which hosts it should be applied to.\n\n\nTo do this we will need to edit the \nconfig/runbooks/init.yml\n file. This file is a master list of any runbook to host mappings. To apply our runbook to all hosts we can simply insert the following into this file.\n\n\n*\n:\n\n  \n-\n \nnginx\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first field \n'*'\n is a Glob based matching used against the target hostname. In this case since the value is \n*\n, all hosts will be matched.\n\n\nIf we wished to limit this runbook to severs with naming scheme of \nweb001.example.com\n we could do so with the following modification.\n\n\nweb*\n:\n\n  \n-\n \nnginx\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecifying multiple targets and runbooks\n\n\nIt is possible to specify multiple host and runbook mappings such as the above. The below is an example of what an \nrunbooks/init.yml\n may look like for a environment hosting a two tier web application.\n\n\n*\n:\n\n  \n-\n \ncpu\n\n  \n-\n \nmem_free\n\n  \n-\n \ndisk_free\n\n  \n-\n \nntp\n\n  \n-\n \nssh\n\n\nweb*\n:\n\n  \n-\n \nnginx\n\n  \n-\n \nuwsgi\n\n\ndb*\n:\n\n  \n-\n \nmysql\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt this point we have a basic runbook that is being applied to all hosts. To make these changes take effect, simply restart Automatron.",

There are two types of health checks within Automatron.  \nArbitrary shell commands\n and \nPlugin executables\n. In this guide we will walk through defining two health checks, one of each type.\n\n\nThe below runbook is a sample that this guide will be based on.\n\n\nname\n:\n \nCheck NGINX\n\n\nschedule\n:\n \n*/2\n \n*\n \n*\n \n*\n \n*\n\n\nchecks\n:\n\n  \nnginx_is_running\n:\n\n    \nexecute_from\n:\n \ntarget\n\n    \ntype\n:\n \ncmd\n\n    \ncmd\n:\n \nservice nginx status\n\n  \nport_443_is_up\n:\n\n    \nexecute_from\n:\n \ntarget\n\n    \ntype\n:\n \nplugin\n\n    \nplugin\n:\n \nnetwork/tcp_connect.py\n\n    \nargs\n:\n \n--host=localhost --port 443\n\n\nactions\n:\n\n  \nrestart_nginx\n:\n\n    \nexecute_from\n:\n \ntarget\n\n    \ntrigger\n:\n \n2\n\n    \nfrequency\n:\n \n300\n\n    \ncall_on\n:\n\n      \n-\n \nWARNING\n\n      \n-\n \nCRITICAL\n\n      \n-\n \nUNKNOWN\n\n    \ntype\n:\n \ncmd\n\n    \ncmd\n:\n \nservice nginx restart\n\n  \nremove_from_dns\n:\n\n    \nexecute_from\n:\n \nremote\n\n    \ntrigger\n:\n \n0\n\n    \nfrequency\n:\n \n0\n\n    \ncall_on\n:\n\n      \n-\n \nWARNING\n\n      \n-\n \nCRITICAL\n\n      \n-\n \nUNKNOWN\n\n    \ntype\n:\n \nplugin\n\n    \nplugin\n:\n \ncloudflare/dns.py\n\n    \nargs\n:\n \nremove test@example.com apikey123 example.com --content 10.0.0.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the above example, there are two health checks defined \nnginx_is_running\n and \nport_443_is_up\n. In the below section we will break down each of these health checks to better understand how health checks are defined.\n\n\nA command based health check\n\n\nCommand based health checks are one of the simplest concepts in Automatron. This type of health check allows users to define a command that is executed to determine the health status of a target.\n\n\nThis is accomplished by Automatron simply logging into the target system over SSH and executing the defined command. The exit code of the executed command is then used to determine the status of the health check.\n\n\nThe below sample is the \nnginx_is_running\n command based health check.\n\n\n  \nnginx_is_running\n:\n\n    \nexecute_from\n:\n \ntarget\n\n    \ntype\n:\n \ncmd\n\n    \ncmd\n:\n \nservice nginx status\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this sample we can see that there are 3 values required for command based health checks. Those values are \nexecute_from\n, \ntype\n, and \ncmd\n. Let's go ahead and break down these values to gain a better understanding of what they mean and tell Automatron to do.\n\n\nExecute from\n\n\nThe \nexecute_from\n field is used to specify where to run the health check. Acceptable values for this field are \ntarget\n which is used to execute the health check on the monitored node itself and \nremote\n. The \nremote\n setting will tell Automatron to execute the health check from the system running Automatron itself.\n\n\nIn our case the command we wish to execute can only be executed from the monitored system itself, as such the value of this field will be \ntarget\n.\n\n\nType\n\n\nThe \ntype\n field is used to specify what type of health check this check is. Acceptable values are \ncmd\n or \nplugin\n. In this case, since we are defining a command based health check our value is set to \ncmd\n.\n\n\nCommand\n\n\nThe \ncmd\n field is used to specify the shell command to execute. In our example the command is simply \nservice nginx status\n. However, this field can support much more complicated commands such as the below example.\n\n\ncmd\n:\n \n/usr/bin/curl -Lw \nResponse %{http_code}\\\\n\n http://10.0.0.1 -o /dev/null | egrep \nResponse [200|301]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is not uncommon to use multiple commands connected with output redirection and conditionals within a runbook.\n\n\nA plugin based health check\n\n\nPlugin based health checks are similar to Command Based health checks in that the exit code is used to determine status. Where these checks differ is that Automatron will copy an executable to the target system and then execute that executable with the specified arguments.\n\n\nBelow is an example Plugin health check.\n\n\nport_443_is_up\n:\n\n  \nexecute_from\n:\n \ntarget\n\n  \ntype\n:\n \nplugin\n\n  \nplugin\n:\n \nnetwork/tcp_connect.py\n\n  \nargs\n:\n \n--host=localhost --port 443\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlugin type health checks have 4 configuration items \nexecute_from\n, \ntype\n, \nplugin\n \n \nargs\n. Let's go ahead and break down these values to gain a better understanding of what they mean and tell Automatron to do.\n\n\nExecute from \n Type\n\n\nThe \nexecute_from\n and \ntype\n fields are common fields for every runbook. The way they are applied for plugin health checks is the same as the way they are applied for command based health checks. As such we will skip repeating these fields in this section.\n\n\nPlugin\n\n\nThe \nplugin\n field is used to specify the location of the plugin executable. This is a relative file path starting from the value of the \nplugin_path\n parameter located within the \nconfig/config.yml\n configuration file.\n\n\nFor example, a plugin located at \n/path/to/plugins/checks/mycheck/mycheck.pl\n would require the value of \nmycheck/mycheck.pl\n.\n\n\nPlugin Arguments\n\n\nThe \nargs\n field is used to specify the arguments to provide the plugin executable. In the example above the plugin will be executed as follows by Automatron\n\n\n$ /path/to/plugins/checks/network/tcp_connect.py --host\n=\nlocalhost --port \n443\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing Exit Codes to relay health check status\n\n\nAutomatron follows the \nNagios\n model for health check exit codes. When a health check is executed the exit code is used to inform Automatron of the results. The below list is a map of acceptable exit codes and how they relate to Automatron health check status.\n\n\n\n\nOK\n: Requires a successful exit code of \n0\n\n\nWARNING\n: Is indicated by an exit code of \n1\n\n\nCRITICAL\n: Is indicated by an exit code of \n2\n\n\nUNKNOWN\n: Is indicated by any other exit code\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\nSince Automatron supports the \nNagios\n exit code strategy most Nagios compliant health checks can also be used with Automatron.",

In this guide we will be breaking down these two actions to gain a better understanding of how they work.\n\n\nA command based actions\n\n\nLike health checks, Automatron actions also support arbitrary shell commands. When executing this type of action Automatron simply logs into the target system and executes the defined command.\n\n\nThe below example is a simple action that logs into the target system and executes the \nservice nginx restart\n command.\n\n\nrestart_nginx\n:\n\n \nexecute_from\n:\n \ntarget\n\n \ntrigger\n:\n \n2\n\n \nfrequency\n:\n \n300\n\n \ncall_on\n:\n\n   \n-\n \nWARNING\n\n   \n-\n \nCRITICAL\n\n   \n-\n \nUNKNOWN\n\n \ntype\n:\n \ncmd\n\n \ncmd\n:\n \nservice nginx restart\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis action has 6 main fields defined; \nexecute_from\n, \ntrigger\n, \nfrequency\n, \ncall_on\n, \ntype\n, and \ncmd\n. Let's break down what each of these fields specify and control about action execution.\n\n\nExecute from\n\n\nThe \nexecute_from\n field is used to specify where to run the action. Acceptable values for this field are \ntarget\n, \nremote\n and \nhost\n.\n\n\n\n\ntarget\n - This value will specify that the action should be executed on the monitored host.\n\n\nremote\n - This value will specify that the action is executed from the Automatron server.\n\n\nhost\n - This value will specify that the action is executed from another specified host.\n\n\n\n\nWhen using the \nhost\n value, the alternative host must be specified via a key named \nhost\n. Below is an example of a \nhost\n based action.\n\n\nactions\n:\n\n  \nrestart_mysql\n:\n\n    \nexecute_from\n:\n \nhost\n\n    \nhost\n:\n \n10.0.0.2\n\n    \ntrigger\n:\n \n0\n\n    \nfrequency\n:\n \n300\n\n    \ncall_on\n:\n\n      \n-\n \nWARNING\n\n      \n-\n \nCRITICAL\n\n    \ntype\n:\n \ncmd\n\n    \ncmd\n:\n \nservice mysql restart\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above action will result in Automatron logging into \n10.0.0.2\n and executing \nservice mysql restart\n.\n\n\nTrigger\n\n\nThe \ntrigger\n field is used to specify the number of times a health check returns the state specified within \ncall_on\n. This number \nmust be reached consecutively\n. If for example, the health check returns \nWARNING\n and then \nOK\n; Automatron's internal counter will be reset.\n\n\nFrequecy\n\n\nThe \nfrequency\n field is used to specify the time (in seconds) between action execution. In the above example the action will be executed every \n300\n seconds until either the \ncall_on\n or \ntrigger\n conditions are no longer met.\n\n\nIf you wish to execute an action every time, simply set this value to \n0\n seconds.\n\n\nCall on\n\n\nThe \ncall_on\n field is a YAML list which is used to list the states that should trigger this action. Valid options are \nOK\n, \nWARNING\n, \nCRITICAL\n \n \nUNKNOWN\n.\n\n\nType\n\n\nThe \ntype\n field is used to specify what type of action will be performed. Acceptable values are \ncmd\n or \nplugin\n. This field is required for all actions. Since our action above is a command based action we will specify \ncmd\n.\n\n\nCommand\n\n\nThe \ncmd\n field is used to specify the shell command to execute as part of this action. In the example above the command is simply \nservice nginx restart\n. When this action is executed, Automatron will login to the host specified and execute that command.\n\n\nA plugin based action\n\n\nWhen a command based action is being executed Automatron will login to the target host and execute the command specified. With plugin based actions, Automatron will upload the plugin executable and execute it giving the specified arguments.\n\n\nBelow is a sample Runbook using a plugin based action.\n\n\nremove_from_dns\n:\n\n  \nexecute_from\n:\n \nremote\n\n  \ntrigger\n:\n \n0\n\n  \nfrequency\n:\n \n0\n\n  \ncall_on\n:\n\n    \n-\n \nWARNING\n\n    \n-\n \nCRITICAL\n\n    \n-\n \nUNKNOWN\n\n  \ntype\n:\n \nplugin\n\n  \nplugin\n:\n \ncloudflare/dns.py\n\n  \nargs\n:\n \nremove test@example.com apikey123 example.com --content 10.0.0.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis action has 7 main fields defined; \nexecute_from\n, \ntrigger\n, \nfrequency\n, \ncall_on\n, \ntype\n, \nplugin\n and \nargs\n. Let's break down what each of these fields specify and control about action execution.\n\n\nExecute from, Trigger, Frequency, Call on \n Type\n\n\nAs \nexecute_from\n, \ntrigger\n, \nfrequency\n, \ncall_on\n, and \ntype\n are common fields for every runbook. The way they are applied for plugin actions is the same as the way they are applied for command based actions. As such we will skip repeating these fields in this section.\n\n\nPlugin\n\n\nThe \nplugin\n field is used to specify the location of the plugin executable. This is a relative file path starting from the value of the \nplugin_path\n parameter located within the \nconfig/config.yml\n configuration file.\n\n\nFor example, a plugin located at \n/path/to/plugins/actions/myaction/myaction.pl\n would require the value of \nmyaction/myaction.pl\n.\n\n\nPlugin Arguments\n\n\nThe \nargs\n field is used to specify the arguments to provide the plugin executable. In the example above the plugin will be executed as follows by Automatron\n\n\n$ /path/to/plugins/checks/cloudflare/dns.py remove test@example.com apikey123 example.com --content \n10\n.0.0.1",
